# Structural Dynamics 2020 (4DM00)

The slides for the course on structural dynamics that I reorganized for the course Structural Dynamics in the master Mechanical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology in collaboration with prof.dr. Rob Fey. I have also recorded video lectures for this course, but these cannot be found here.
